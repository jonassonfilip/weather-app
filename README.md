Welcome to my weather app that shows the current weather anywhere on earth. The site should be easy to use and the information explicit.<br>
If the location you're searching for isn't found you will get noticed about that.

## About
This is a school project where we should make a simple site using Reactjs. The instructions were:<br>
"Create a small web application with a nice graphical user interface using ReactJS, which includes at least three react components, uses state and props, makes at least one API call, and is error-free."

## Setup
Fork the repository to your own account.
<br><br>
Clone the forked repository to your local machine. Use the CLI or "Open with GitHub Desktop".
<br><br>
Install the required dependencies with:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server with:
```
npm start
```

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute and create issues. Before you make a pull request; make sure there's no errors in the code.
<br>
Have a nice day! :)
